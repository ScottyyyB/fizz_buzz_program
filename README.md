# Fizz Buzz Program

## Description:

This Fizz Buzz Program is a program I've made from the popular Fizz Buzz program, which is commonly used during interviews for dev jobs. This Fizz Program does the following:

* Returns `fizz` if the number is divisible by 3
* Returns `buzz` if the number is divisible by 5
* Return `fizzbuzz` if the number is divisible by 15
* Returns the same number if none of the above conditions are met

## Gems Used:
* "rspec"

## Using The Application:
Simply call the fizz buzz method like so: `fizz_buzz(number)`

The number argument needs to take an input, so for example: `fizz_buzz(1)`


If you want to see the output, add a puts or print in front, like so:
`puts fizz_buzz(2)`
